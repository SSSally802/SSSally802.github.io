        <h3>Software Requirements Analysis Based on Multi-view Microblog Text Mining</h3>
        <p>Microblog is one of the most well-liked communal webs this day. Previous research establish that users employ microblogs to communicate about software applications via short messages. This kind of brief message is very useful for software requirements analysis. This is a valuable source of information when determining the requirements for future software releases in the course of software evolution. However, such a large amount of data makes a manual analysis unfeasible. At the same time, the user's unstructured and informal language also brings a lot of difficulties for machine analysis.
        </p>
        <p>As a result, this project is dedicated to proposing a new software requirements analysis method, which takes microblog as the carrier. Based on data mining, we can mine users' opinions from multiple perspectives such as microblog square, topics and comments. Then, based on topic modeling and emotional analysis, text information can be extracted and analyzed to obtain the requirements information for software. Compared to earlier analysis of app store information, the obtain information is the most up-to-date and real-time user needs.</p>
        </p>
        <p>The figure below is the method flow proposed in this research.</p>
        <p style="text-align: center"><img src = flowchart.jpeg width="574" height="347" alt="Project flow chart"></p>
        <p>In this research, we mainly use the following methods to achieve panoramic image stitching.</p>
          <p>• Integrated requirement engineering, data mining, and NLP technology, developed a software, based on comprehensive
            analysis of user needs, provided software developers and the development direction of the next version of the software
          </p>
          <p>• Used social media in the form of microblog to innovatively develop multi-perspective evaluation methods to make the
            results more comprehensive and balanced
          </p>
          <p>• Used NLP to process the original user language, and used Naive Bayes Classifier and Topic Modeling Algorithm to perform
            classification processing, and finally conducted comprehensive analysis and multi-perspective evaluation
          </p>
          <p>• Designed the software to crawl network information in real time, automatically updated the software content, followed up
            with the latest needs of users, and visually presented the analysis results to the developers
          </p>
        <p>The final research results are presented in the applet, as shown in the image below.</p>
